VideoRecorder

This is my first and only app to endup in Danger's Catalog. The 4.6 OTA added Video Recording capabilities to the OS. Using the default Video Recorder in the Camera application recording was limited to 30 seconds. It's my belief that this was due to the fact that the devices supported didn't have any hardware encoders and this was all done in Software. The device would run out of memory very fast, and encoding to 3gp would fail with ease.

Video Recorder pushed the limits of the Sidekick LX and Sidekick 2008 and extended recording to 50 seconds.

It was introduced in the Sidekick Catalog in March 2009 went on to sell approximately 38,000 units at $1.99. Video Recorder was finally removed in March 2011 when Danger and Microsoft shut the service down.

Thanks again to Prash for the artwork.
